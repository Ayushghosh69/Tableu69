# Bike Buyer Story — Tableau Workbook and PNG Previews

This branch contains a Tableau-ready dataset and an automated pipeline to generate PNG previews for a 4‑visualization story about who buys bikes.

Contents
- data/Bikers buyer.csv — source dataset (as provided)
- workbook/Bike-Buyer-Story.twb — Tableau workbook (open in Desktop; File > Save As > .twbx to package)
- images/ — generated PNG previews of the four visuals
- scripts/generate_images.py — builds PNGs from the CSV
- requirements.txt — Python dependencies for local rendering
- .github/workflows/build-images.yml — CI job to generate and commit PNGs on push

Open the workbook
1) Open `workbook/Bike-Buyer-Story.twb` in Tableau Desktop.
2) If prompted for the data source, point to `data/Bikers buyer.csv`.
3) The four sheets and dashboard are built per the story plan below.

Convert to .twbx (packaged workbook)
- File > Save As > “Tableau Packaged Workbook (*.twbx)” to create a single file including data.

What the four visuals show
1) Shorter Commutes, Higher Bike Buying — 100% stacked bar comparing purchase share by commute distance.
2) Fewer Cars, More Bikes — ranked row bars of purchase rate by number of cars.
3) The Commute Effect by Region — heatmap of purchase rate by Region × Commute Distance.
4) Bike Buying Peaks in Midlife — lollipop chart of purchase rate by age group.

PNG previews
- A GitHub Action builds four PNGs to `images/`:
  - `viz1_commute_100pct.png`
  - `viz2_cars_rowbar.png`
  - `viz3_region_commute_heatmap.png`
  - `viz4_age_lollipop.png`
- The workflow runs automatically on pushes to the `tableau-viz` branch and commits the generated images.

Local generation (optional)
- Python 3.10+
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python scripts/generate_images.py`

Color & formatting
- Yes/positive = blue (#2C7FB8), No/neutral = gray (#BDBDBD)
- Percent labels where applicable; y-axis from 0%; clear descriptive titles.

Notes
- If you move files, re-point the data source when opening the `.twb`.
- You can export high‑res images via Worksheet > Export > Image in Tableau, or use the included Python script for quick previews.
